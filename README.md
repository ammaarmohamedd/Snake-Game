# Snake Game

This is a classic Snake Game built with Python and the `pygame` library. The objective of the game is to control a snake, collect food to grow longer, and avoid colliding with the walls or the snake’s own body.

## How to Play

- Use the **arrow keys** to move the snake.
- Collect food items that appear randomly on the screen. Each time the snake eats a piece of food, it grows longer.
- Avoid running into the walls or the snake’s own body. If this happens, the game will end.

## Scoring

- Each piece of food you collect increases your score by 1. Try to survive and grow the snake as long as possible to maximize your score!

## Requirements

- **Python 3.x**: Make sure Python is installed on your computer.
- **pygame**: Install pygame by running:

  ```bash
  pip install pygame
```
